### Deployed Site 
[Healthplus+](http://healthpluscv19.surge.sh/)

### Welcome 
As many businesses across the country prepare to re-open their doors for customers, 
this app will provide locations where we can all get  our hands on some personal protective equipment. 
It will also provide hospitals and/or clinics where one can get vaccinated. 
In order to achieve full crud functionality, a user will be able to create, read, update, and delete, 
a private practice in their area that offers PPE and/or vaccines to locals.
